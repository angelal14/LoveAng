  <h1>Big Banks See Deposit Surge</h1>
  <h2>Money, Banks, and the Economy</h2>

	<p>
    
    In Q1 companies and consumers flooded U.S. banks with a record $1 trillion of deposits. Most of the $1 trillion flowed into the banks in a two-week span in March, more deposits between Feb. 26 and March 18 than in any month of 2019. Big banks are getting a disproportionate amount of this increase in deposits ($422 Milion increase, seasonally adjusted). However, it is worth noting that although big banks overperformed, small banks also increased their deposits. Furthermore, despite the top-25 banks having declining debt in the last seven months, debt spiked by $100 billion in the same time period that deposits rose. This is likely because banks are lending more money out, particularly to small businesses that have less in savings. These small businesses then use the money to pay employees, who then put the money back into deposit accounts. <br/><br/>

    But why do they put it in deposit accounts? People are spending less due to an inability to go out. Besides spending, their options are to store their cash in stocks or bonds, the bank, or under their mattress. Most people know that it is best not to do the latter option, stocks are currently volatile and intimidating for most individuals, and bonds are probably not considered by small, inexperienced investors. Therefore, that leaves banks as the most viable option. <br/><br/>

    One interesting difference between the current recession and the 2008 one is the unique trust in banks. The Wall Street Journal reports that “in 2008, America’s biggest banks were the bad guys that nearly destroyed the economy. Now, they are a refuge for jittery consumers and businesses waiting out the shutdown." The Motley Fool furthers, "Whether you believe the label 'too big to fail' or not, it sure doesn't hurt to attract deposits in an environment like this” (Motley Fool). <br/><br/>

    Confidence is banks is perhaps due to reforms in the government safety net post-2008, like better consumer protection, resolution authority, and systemic risk regulation ensured under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Because such reforms were tailored to reduce risk among big banks, as such, big banks may be benefitting from most of these new deposits since they may be viewed as safer. Furthermore, the notion that systemic firms—or big banks—are ‘too big to fail’ (as the government would always bail them out) would certainly also encourage deposits to flood to big banks. On the contrary, small and local banks have less name recognition and, as 2008 taught us, can fail. </p>
