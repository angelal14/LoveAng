  <h1>Big Banks See Deposit Surge</h1>

In Q1, companies and consumers flooded U.S. banks with a record $1 trillion of deposits. Most of these deposits flowed into the banks in a two-week span in March, more than in any month of 2019. Of the $1 trillion, big banks are getting $422 million. Despite the top-25 banks having declining debt in the last seven months, debt spiked by $100 billion in the same time period that deposits rose. This is likely because banks are lending more money out, particularly to small businesses that have less in savings. These small businesses then use the money to pay employees, who then put the money back into deposit accounts. <br/><br/><br/>

But why do they put their money in deposit accounts? People are spending less due to an inability to go out. Besides spending, their options are to store their cash in stocks or bonds, the bank, or (like economists like to say) under their mattress. Most people know that it is best not to do the latter option; the stock market is currently volatile; and bonds are probably not considered by small, inexperienced investors. Therefore, that leaves banks as the most viable option. <br/><br/><br/>

One interesting difference between the current recession and the 2008 one is the unique trust in banks. The Wall Street Journal reports this month that “in 2008, America’s biggest banks were the bad guys that nearly destroyed the economy. Now, they are a refuge for jittery consumers and businesses waiting out the shutdown." The Motley Fool furthers earlier this month, "Whether you believe the label 'too big to fail' or not, it sure doesn't hurt to attract deposits in an environment like this.” <br/><br/><br/>

Confidence in banks is perhaps due to reforms in the government safety net post-2008, like better consumer protection, resolution authority, and systemic risk regulation ensured under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Because such reforms were tailored to reduce risk among big banks and their lending practices, consumers see these banks as safer and thus shift most of their deposits in their direction. Furthermore, the notion that systemically important financial institutions are ‘too big to fail’ (and so the government would bail them out) would certainly also encourage deposits to flood to big banks. On the contrary, small and local banks have less name recognition and, as 2008 taught us, can fail. <br/><br/><br/>
