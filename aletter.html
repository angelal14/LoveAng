    Dear James, <br/><br/>
    I finally know why I want you so much. You never tried to call me yours. Most other guys couldn’t stand letting me be intimate with anyone else, thinking they could own my body before even defining our relationship. More than that, their fragile egos wanted control over my heart. But when I said to you, “Sorry, I’m spending time with someone else right now,” you said, “Great, thanks for letting me know.” And every time I whimsically visited, you let me have my way with you. You never asked for anything in return in the morning. I guess that’s why I always came back.<br/><br/> 
    I noticed that all of our best memories were formed in the dark. But of course they were. We met on Tinder. The dark was intimate. In it, your tongue learned my body more than your eyes ever could have. You fell in love with the tangy sweetness of my cum. So many times, I felt so perfectly in the moment that as soon as the tension released, I promptly realized I hadn’t been monitoring—nor remembering—the noises I had been making for the last twenty minutes. Those were the most enjoyable times I’ve ever had with you...with any partner, actually. <br/><br/>
    But the dark wasn’t just sex. It was where I confessed to you that I was hopelessly and utterly broken. It was where you heard me, pulled me in, and squeezed. Even in the dark, you saw right through me. “Don’t work hard to get back at him,” you said, “work hard because you’re capable and deserve it for yourself.” I still think about the time we were almost intimate but if we proceeded, I couldn’t spend the night. You didn’t even hesitate—the opened condom fell to the ground and your words were all I could make sense of when everything was black: “That’s crazy, I’d much rather hold you tonight.” Wet from anticipation, I pouted like a brat, not realizing that I’d actually prefer being your little spoon while your arm reached over me that night, our hands intertwined and cradled to my heart. With you, I was made to feel beautiful and safe again, however reluctantly. <br/><br/>
    I distinctly remember waking up in that cramped dorm of yours one morning, squeezed into your twin sized bed, listening to the roaring fan. Staring at gray shapes illuminated by dawn filtering through the window of a rural liberal arts college. Feeling an acute awareness of my existence, of the stillness, the melancholy. Feeling that, somehow, I was meant to be with you. To know you. To witness your casual intelligence, humor and wisdom. To hear you say, “Life’s too short to be mean.” With you, life suddenly became simple. When we watched Brooklyn 99 together on the couch, I didn’t feel like the happiest girl in the world, and I didn’t want to; I felt like the most at-peace girl in the world. Like I didn’t need anything else. Like you were enough. <br/><br/>
    But I won’t subject this letter to the rose-tinted lens of looking back at fond memories. I’ll be more honest. I derived validation from you. When I wouldn’t get a text back, I’d waver between hurt pangs and feigned indifference. We walked the line between friends with benefits and lovers. I felt disgusting for fucking someone else two hours before I came over to watch Brooklyn 99 with you that night, but I wouldn’t have changed a thing. And that’s the thing about you—you wouldn’t care anyway because you knew that we owed each other nothing. That’s exactly why you put your nicotine addiction above me that night and kicked me out in the morning. Should I have been surprised when we inevitably cared about each other without really caring? <br/><br/>
    Waiting for your texts, aching to see you again, and the way I liked your flaws became out of my control. Increasingly, I became aware of how it reminded me of the traumatic limbo I once lived in, where I loved every last bit of a struggling addict a year out of rehab. I remembered wanting to help and hearing the misery in the way he told me I couldn’t. His resignation during that relapse. His self-loath displaced onto me. And the deeper I cared, the deeper he dug his own pain and influence into my young, malleable mind. But...when I ran from you, you said, “Angela, I would never want to be the reason you’re struggling. It’s mature of you to talk this out with me. So, thank you.” <br/><br/>
    But I wonder if I irreversibly ruined us that day. Ever since, you’d stopped asking if you could keep texting me simply because you liked hearing from me. Time passed and when I was finally ready to commit, it seemed I’d already cemented your indifference. But it was only logical to feel indifferent...you were going to graduate, and I’d have to stay behind another three years. We would never be together again—and wasn’t that the only thing holding us together in the first place? The sex? <br/><br/>
    The reason why I can’t send you this letter is because I’m not even supposed to want you like this. For a while, I was caught up in the romantic notion that our open-ended future together was beautiful. Life brought us together once in an unlikely time and place, mid-heartbreak and in KJ. I trusted that if it was right, we’d find each other again. I was content to wait for you. Wait for when the time was right again and leave it up to fate to decide the place. But who am I fooling? That’s so romantic and beautiful ... and we’re anything but that, aren’t we James? We’re anything but that. <br/><br/>
    Angela
