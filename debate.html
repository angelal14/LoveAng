  <h1>How Debate Has Changed My Life</h1>
  <h2>Angela Li. May 2020.</h2>


<p>(Incomplete, but I'll show you what I have so far...) <br/><br/><br/>

At college I work four part-time jobs: Career Center peer advisor, Quantitative & Symbolic Reasoning Center economics tutor, resident advisor, and economics research assistant. I’m excited for all of these jobs because they each hone in on a specific type of skill: strategizing, communication, developing close relationships, and researching / synthesizing information. Fortunately, at college, I can work on all of these skills across four different centers. But in high school, I developed all of these skills—and those required to ace my job interviews—in just one activity: debate. <br/><br/><br/>

One year ago, I said goodbye to this activity so dear to me. Since then, I have blindly plowed through college without giving much thought to how much I’ve benefited from it. So, I think it’s about time I reflect upon all the different ways debate has shaped who I am today. <br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>

…The kind of creativity that kept me up at night and filled my school notebooks with crucial storyline ideas instead of notes. It was the kind of creative passion that, ever since I was eight years old, pushed me to seek inspiration from fictional novels, life experiences, and soul searching. <br/><br/><br/>
I was fourteen when I joined the debate team. Only fourteen years old and suddenly concerned with Gross Domestic Product, Jim Crow laws, our nation’s refugees and inequality in America’s public education system. Behind the podium, my utter disregard for practicality became obsolete… and so did my love for creative storytelling.
<br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>

It taught me how to dismantle the hidden logic behind an argument. Connect the dots between sources to synthesize a compelling case. Read a piece of policy and map out its possible implications in solid terms—and be creative with those implications. When done correctly, this kind of creativity won me rounds.<br/><br/><br/>
So, at 14 years old, I began to appreciate staying in tune with reality. I dropped the fictional romance novels. Debate grew my mind and its capacity to think outside the box. Although I lost one form of creativity that was dear to me, I was evolving into a person who found energy under pressure, in thinking critically, and reasoning creatively to contribute to conversations that had to be had.
<br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>


The friendships I made were peak high school experience. Between 3 practices a week, school, traveling the region, nights in fancy hotels and overnight summer debate camps, my teammates and I spent nearly half our waking hours together year-round. <br/><br/><br/>
Debate brought together fun, diverse people from my school. We grew fond of each other for our ideas and strong personalities. I found myself really knowing both the people I once wished to be friends with, and likewise, people I would have overlooked. Suddenly I knew them as if they were myself, because we shared similar moments of fear and courage: frantically conducting last-minute research on the bus to the tournament, sweat soaking through our suits, pulse racing as we’re waiting for the judge’s decision, honest discussions on how to be more pleasant to work with, celebrating collectively as we realize a teammate has advanced to the next round and supporting them in any way we can as they become closer to winning the whole damn tournament, rooting for them with all our frantic heart—these were shared experiences that showed us that we were, at the core, very much the same. And very much here for each other.
<br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>

Like sitting in the backseat of my mom’s car in the winter three times a week to attend practice…laying down, my breath visible in the cold air, listening to the engine, thinking to myself: These will be some of the best years of my life.<br/><br/><br/>
Like the first time I spoke in front of a judge, and my voice. Literally. Shook. But I kept going.<br/><br/><br/>
Like when a teammate propped himself up horizontally between a desk and the whiteboard and proceeded to deliver a speech to make us laugh. Like our old captain wearing a dunce cap for being late. Like witnessing 40-minute-long, structured spar debates conducted without anyone taking notes. For fun.<br/><br/><br/>
I still remember the first time I heard a teammate write and deliver a four-minute speech that rhymed. I remember when my teammate wrote a speech connecting whales and aliens to a carbon tax policy using evidence, reasoning, and pure debate skill. I remember staying in a Connecticut hotel for competition, and one night witnessing a slap-boxing fight between two teammates, while holding takeout in my hands and another teammate’s head in my lap.<br/><br/><br/>
Debate gave me fond memories, like the countless times I ran through hallways in a pencil skirt and heels, whispering at my partner Abby to slow down even though we had someplace to be. It gave me the thrill of public speaking—having a multitude of things to say and letting it rush out in a passion—and more importantly, it gave me experience being scared shitless in a room of thirty people but still speaking up.<br/><br/><br/>
Looking back now, the memories are dream-like: the traveling, touring foreign cities, trying Shake Shack for the first time, strategizing as a team the night before the big competition, sprinting through a hotel wearing fuzzy socks and no shoes to meet the pizza guy at 1am… <br/><br/><br/>
I was lucky enough to witness the casual intelligence of my teammates. I shared humorous moments with them. But I'm the most grateful for how my teammates made a commitment to their personal growth on the team, as did I, and we got to benefit from each other in our shared learning.
<br/><br/><br/>

Having cycled through five different debate partners in four years, I am finally fond of adapting to a new partner with a whole new set of strengths and weaknesses. Asking questions like, “even though we won, what could I have done better to make your job easier?” became a habit. Recognizing losses and collaborating to change our strategy in real-time was a must. Since speeches were prepared on the spot, probably the most difficult task was to listen to my partner while I was under pressure. When I had just twenty seconds to assemble an agenda for a two-minute speech, listening to my intuition instead of my partner’s advice was sometimes catastrophic. I had to learn that being under immense pressure was no excuse to shut my partner out. <br/><br/><br/>
To function properly as a team, we had to be finely in tune with each other’s feelings, needs, skills, and schedules. We engaged in compromise of all kinds: splitting work fairly, showing up to practice for each other, trusting each other on a new and risky idea, sharing constructive criticism, and agreeing to self-reflect for team-improvement. I learned to value those serious conversations dedicated to addressing problems that inevitably arose in partnerships. Finding agreement and balance with each of my partners, no matter how long it took, was an integral part of my experience with debate. Despite the sometimes-messy situations, the tears, conflict and stress, I would not give up any of those experiences for the resulting communication & compromise lessons I’ve learned.
<br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>

Besides developing the critical thinking and interpersonal skills previously mentioned, I’ve also learned to:<br/>
-	Speak, even when I’m afraid.<br/><br/>
-	Recognize and adapt to different kinds of audiences who are more receptive to different kinds of persuasion techniques.<br/><br/>
-	Combine economic, political, and social knowledge to construct a complex argument, and get good at communicating it.<br/><br/>
-	Convince a judge that nuclear escalation is, in fact, good (somehow).<br/><br/>
-	Question everything.<br/><br/>
-	And of course, pick and choose my battles wisely (it’s a work in progress).

The memory is still absurd to me: I was captain of the team, Tournament of Champions bound, a senior, yet I stood in the middle of a bustling hallway, sobbing into my hands in front of all my competitors. It was January, and I had finally snapped. My coach stood in front of me, pulling tissues and water out of her purse as she said, “Oh, honey, I’m so sorry for what you’re going through.”<br/><br/><br/> 
Never before had I flinched at the sight of someone so automatically. I had been sitting alone in the cafeteria, barely swallowing my emotions and holding it together. I had just stolen alone-time to process the mess of a debate I just experienced: my partner making bug-eyed, “you’re forgetting to say something important and screwing us over” faces at me while I was at the podium, the embarrassment, our judge appearing confused whenever I spoke, my stammering, my self-confidence plummeting by the second—not just to the ground, but six feet under. <br/><br/><br/>
When my partner approached me later in the cafeteria, I reflexively stumbled away. Seeing my reaction, he softened up and asked to talk. Despite an hour of talking, though, I still felt uneasy. I truly believed he was the better debater, and that I was at fault for our loss. Imposter syndrome overwhelmed my self-image. And when it was time to go home that night, everyone was shuffling out of the building when suddenly, amongst a crowd of adults, competitors, and teammates, I lost control over my emotions. And the rest was history.

<br/><br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>

This partner of mine had been talking down to me for a long time. He deleted changes I made to shared documents without consulting me, and when I brought it up, he would brush me off. At first, we were successful anyway and qualified to TOC together, but then we started losing and I secretly blamed myself for weeks. It wasn’t until that mortifying moment in the hallway, face in my hands, that I knew something was seriously wrong and I needed to stand up for myself. <br/><br/><br/>
I started by letting him know we needed to have a serious conversation, but not immediately. That way, he would have time to reflect upon why he thought we needed to talk. It also allowed me to reflect on all the issues I had with our teamwork and how to lay them out with structure and specificity. When we met up later, I let him know that I needed to be listened to first. I presented my thoughts without accusing him of being a bad person. I spoke using “I felt” terms instead of “you did this and that” terms. And he listened. Then, he voiced his perspective. And we talked through it. At the end of the day, we were a team. And as it turned out, we grew from this conversation; I noticed real changes in his behavior. From then on, we were more in-tune with each other and became genuinely good friends—really. <br/><br/><br/>
From this experience, I learned this: <br/><br/><br/>
1. Being assertive while also treating the other person with unconditional positive regard works. To me, this means don't accept inappropriate behavior from others, but when addressing that behavior, be assertive in a way that still allows the other person to grow rather than alienating them and locking them into the "bad person" image.<br/><br/><br/>
2. There should be no shame in feelings. They are real because you feel them. So, acknowledge them. Verbalize them.<br/><br/><br/>
3. There can be incongruence between my actual relationships and how I perceive them. So, I should always be actively communicating to reduce this incongruence.<br/><br/><br/>
4. I was the only varsity woman on our team for a year; it was weird and sometimes loney. So, I want to create a network of support with other girls, wherever I go. I want to spread love in everything I do. I want to be powerful so that I can empower others. <br/><br/><br/>
5. Sometimes, showing vulnerability can force necessary change. There should be no shame in feelings. In expressing myself, I became better connected to my coach and my partner. But more importantly, I would like to think doing so legitimized any similar feelings my younger counterparts had. If even their captain could collapse under that weight, then any similar feeling they might have must be very real and strong and should be addressed.  <br/><br/><br/>

Ultimately, what matters is that we use the skills we gain from this activity to speak up to make it a more inclusive and educational space for everyone. Which leads me to number nine…
