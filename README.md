## Motivation
Writing in quarantine. Getting my feelings out. Not so much for sharing. Personal use.

## Description
"Love, Ang" is my personal blog where I (might) post writing, pictures and song recommendations. Writing ranges from current events to very personal thoughts and problems.

## New Skills
- Creating a grid (html)
- Creating a table (html) - Using **rowspan, border, border collapse**
- Creating a top navigation (html)
- Linking additional html pages to a <div></div>
- Absolute and relative positioning (CSS)
- Using margins, padding, along with the basic text-align, background-color and color (CSS)
- Referencing specific elements from webpage to design/decorate (CSS) - e.g. referencing classes, IDs, and headings. Learning when appropriate to create a class or assign an ID in html in order to make CSS process easier later on.
- Navigating repl.it to design a webpage: upload image files, create additional html files, switch between html and CSS... 

## Challenges / Lessons
- **Biggest challenge:** using absolute positioning in order to keep my blog heading & posts IN PLACE! Before I learned abs pos, my heading and posts would shift all around and misalign if you changed the size of your window. It looked awkward at some times. So I made them stay in place (relative to each other) by setting up a parent class for both the "topnav" class and "wrapper" class. I gave the parent class a height, width, set the background color to the same color as the actual background, positioned it 20% away from the left and positioned it relatively. Then the Topnav and Wrapper classes will both reference that & stay a certain percentage to the right of the invisible parent rectangle I created (in order to stay centered). I had to do some guess-and-check to ensure that it's centered. Unfortunately it was not as easy as making it 50% to the left (because then they **start** at 50%, not actually centered at 50%) so hopefully I can find a way to do this more elegantly as I keep learning... 
- Rowspan (html tables)
- **Learned:** html 'prints' elements in the order you 'declare' them in index.html (I put those words in quotes because they sound very Python-y as that is the first language I learned and I'm not sure if they're applicable here) 
- Learned: syntax of html and CSS in general. Using semicolons and brackets. 

## Future Steps 
- Learn all the other kinds of positioning 
- Get better at absolute positioning 
- Find a more elegant way to do what I did for abs pos 
- Maybe add a 'current events' tab to my blog?

## Brief Comment
I literally stayed up all night to figure out the absolute positioning issue...IT'S 4:33AM RIGHT NOW and I finally figured it out. I couldn't stop. And then I did it. Thank God for YouTube videos. Signing off @ 22 July 2020.
