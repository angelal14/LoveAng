### Motivation
Writing in quarantine. Getting my feelings out. Not so much for sharing. Personal use.

### Description
"Love, Ang" is my personal blog where I (might) post writing, pictures and song recommendations. Writing ranges from current events to very personal thoughts and problems.

### New Skills
- Creating a grid (html)
- Creating a table (html) - Using **rowspan, border, border collapse**
- Creating a top navigation (html)
- Linking additional html pages to a <div></div>
- Absolute and relative positioning (CSS)
- Using margins, padding, along with the basic text-align, background-color and color (CSS)
- Referencing specific elements from webpage to design/decorate (CSS) - e.g. referencing classes, IDs, and headings. Learning when appropriate to create a class or assign an ID in html in order to make CSS process easier later on.
- Navigating repl.it to design a webpage: upload image files, create additional html files, switch between html and CSS...
