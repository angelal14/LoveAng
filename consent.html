  <h1>Content Warning: Sexual Assault</h1>

  <p>
  For the last few months I didn't want to think that I was sexually assaulted. He convinced me that it didn’t happen. But I remember feeling like something was extremely off that night. <br/><br/>
 
  He came under the pretense to drop off a gift, which I thought I’d say ‘thank you’ for in the car and then leave. I was alarmed when he immediately started driving. I hinted that I wanted to go home, but he convinced me that everything was going to be alright. I felt I owed him for the gift. So I went along with it.<br/><br/>

While we hooked up, I wasn’t comfortable. I stopped and said, “I’m anxious. I want to go.” He said, “Go where?” I said, “Home.” He asked, “Just 10 more minutes?” I was confused and uncomfortable. Was my anxiety not a good enough reason? I thought I had to find a ‘good’ reason to leave so that he’d stop trying to change my mind, but nothing came up. I recognized that anything could happen while we were alone. It was dark. He was stronger, he had the car keys. So I agreed to three minutes. I never intended to let him in me.<br/><br/>
 
He kept pushing me to do more. I couldn’t tell if I convinced myself to want it to appease him or if I really wanted it, but I faked most of it. Looking back, pushing sex on a partner who has expressed ANY form of discomfort for ANY REASON is NOT NORMAL. But he put all the blame on me. “Why didn’t you just say no?”<br/><br/>

To that, I say, why does the burden of the conversation have to solely lie on the person who’s uncomfortable? Though I said ‘okay,’ there was no safe space for me to say ‘no.’<br/><br/>

He admitted to pressuring me, apparently because he thought I was only concerned about getting home late. As he put it, it was “us against the situation.” But the thing about affirmative consent is that it doesn’t really hurt to ensure that it’s there. But it does hurt to assume it is and then relentlessly convince your partner to stay and fuck you. Because that’s not “easing your partner’s nerves” or “being more confident,” that’s coercion. And coercion is r*pe.<br/><br/>
 
Until two weeks ago, I thought, “It wasn’t violent. I wasn’t assaulted.” But the first time I read about sexual coercion, it felt so familiar I almost cried. Finally it made sense: my fear & discomfort then, my aversion to sex now. Finally I’m not confused or sorry.<br/><br/>

Some real-life applications:<br/><br/>
1. Attraction ≠ consent. Assault within a relationship is valid. Check yourself, even if you’re hot.<br/><br/>
2. You don’t need to justify not wanting sex. “I just don’t want it” is more than enough.
The onus of the conversation doesn’t lie solely on the person who’s uncomfortable. Create a safe space for honesty with your partner(s).<br/><br/>
3. Stop being a normalizer and/or bystander. Practice saying: “What you just said is harmful. That’s not okay with me.” (This applies to race issues, too).<br/><br/>
4. It’s NOT OK to leverage your personal problems to guilt someone into having sex.<br/><br/> 
5. I don’t believe in cancel culture. But if you made a mistake, take ownership & do better. It’s not about your ego.<br/><br/>
 
Finally, the shame is very real. Although I washed that night down the shower drain countless times, I still feel dirty. I’m worried I’m promiscuous. I used to dislike my body and myself. I was afraid if I told people, eventually they’d think it’s my fault because—really, how many bad things can happen to you at age 18? I thought of ways I could’ve prevented it. Suddenly I was questioning my ability to advocate for myself. So I have to always say, “Ang, it wasn’t your fault.”<br/><br/>

Writing this helps. So does connection. I understand this issue is pervasive, so my support extends to people who identify with any gender. I can try my best to be your supporter in private, your advocate in public, or someone to share your story with in confidence. My offer has no expiration date. Remember I believe you. Let’s make this world a nicer place. </p>

Reasons why “You should have just said no” is wrong.<br/><br/>

1. It’s gaslighting - Implies that there was a safe space to say ‘no’ when there wasn’t. Relies on victim’s self-doubt. <br/>
E.g. You were uncomfortable, but you still could’ve done more to prevent your assault, not me.<br/><br/>

2. It unfairly shifts all blame on the victim.<br/>
E.g. I wanted to think you wanted it even though I never asked, how dare you not correct me. It was your fault you got hurt by me.<br/>
Avoids the uncomfortable question— “Why didn’t I ask for affirmative consent?”<br/>
It soothes your ego. You want to think it wasn’t your fault. How could you have known? It was your victim’s weakness & stupidity that led to miscommunication. They misled you. (When really, communication is a two-way street).
