	<h1>Change the Way You Talk About Sexual Assault</h1>
	<h2>Content Warning: Sexual Assault</h2>
	<h3>May 26, 2020</h3>

<p>

Why do schools teach kids how to recognize red flags in an abusive relationship without teaching them how to recognize abusive behaviors within themselves? When I was coerced into undesired sexual acts by an ex earlier this year, I spent weeks repenting my own stupidity—I knew the red flags, how could I have let this slip by? But when discussing my feelings with my friend Brenne, I realized how wrong that mindset was. When I had confronted my ex about this months earlier, he exploded with rage and vehement denial. “You were not raped,” he yelled, and proceeded to call me vile names. Worse than the fact that he cornered and pressured me into unwanted acts, he denied accountability altogether. At the time, I apologized and ended the relationship. Thinking about it now, I am disgusted and angry. <br/><br/><br/>

When teenagers are taught to avoid red flags and to bring pepper spray, what they are implicitly being taught is that they need to prevent their own assault. What needs to change is this: schools need to teach teens how to ask themselves—Has my partner affirmatively consented? Have I possibly made them feel uncomfortable to speak up? Am I pushing their boundaries? What should I do if I’m made aware that I hurt someone, or recognize that I’m the abuser? How can I do better? Because in a room full of potential victims and potential perpetrators, why only educate the potential victims on prevention? <br/><br/><br/>

While the change needs to stem from education, society’s dialogue needs to change, too. The prevent-your-own-assault framework is so established and goes unquestioned…and that is why my ex still likely thinks he did no wrong. The fact that survivors are even questioned about their attire and what they were drinking ‘that night’ is clearly unfair; autonomy over your own body and the freedom to wear/drink what you want are not mutually exclusive rights. Likewise, the fact that victims of sexual coercion are asked, “Why didn’t you say no?” (which my ex said to me, by the way) is unfair because by definition, coercion implies that there was no safe space to say “no.” For reference, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, sexual coercion “happens when you are pressured, tricked, threatened, or forced in a nonphysical way. Coercion can make you think you owe sex to someone. It might be from someone who has power over you.” People in power need to stop searching to the ends of earth what the survivor did wrong and start questioning what made the perpetrator think their act was okay. Asking yourself if you’ve potentially been unfair, coercive or abusive needs to be normalized. Asking yourself if your partner is truly comfortable—and affirming it with them—needs to be normalized. And that starts with changing the way we’re educated. Because if we’re not even taught how to recognize our own flawed behaviors, how should we expect improvements in all of society?

Some real-life applications:<br/><br/>
1. Attraction ≠ consent. Assault within a relationship is valid. Check yourself, even if you’re hot.<br/><br/>
2. You don’t need to justify not wanting sex. “I just don’t want it” is more than enough. <br/><br/>
3. The onus of the conversation doesn’t lie solely on the person who’s uncomfortable. Create a safe space for honesty with your partner(s).<br/><br/>
4. Stop being a normalizer and/or bystander. Practice saying: “What you just said is harmful. That’s not okay with me.” <br/><br/>
5. It’s NOT OK to leverage your personal problems to guilt someone into having sex.<br/><br/> 
6. I don’t believe in cancel culture. But if you made a mistake, take ownership & do better. It’s not about your ego.<br/><br/>
 
Finally, the shame is very real. Although I washed that night down the shower drain countless times, I still feel dirty. I’m worried I’m promiscuous. I used to dislike my body and myself. I was afraid if I told people, eventually they’d think it’s my fault because—really, how many bad things can happen to you at age 18? I thought of ways I could’ve prevented it. Suddenly I was questioning my ability to advocate for myself. So I have to always say, “Ang, it wasn’t your fault.”<br/><br/>

Writing this helps. So does connection. I understand this issue is pervasive, so my support extends to people who identify with any gender. I can try my best to be your supporter in private, your advocate in public, or someone to share your story with in confidence. My offer has no expiration date. Remember I believe you. Let’s make this world a nicer place. </p>
