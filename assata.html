  <p id=assatap> One of the most meaningful ways to enjoy an autobiography of an accomplished figure is to identify the fundamental, necessary changes made in that figure’s life that led them to success. In her autobiography Assata, former member of the Black Liberation Army Assata Shakur details her experiences in prison as a Black woman in the 70s, as well as her development from a child to an educated, empowered social activist and revolutionary. She uses retrospective comments on her old views to highlight how demystification regarding white values has grown her personal sense of beauty and identity, and how her personal change is a political statement. Moreover, seeking knowledge on Black history helps Assata contextualize her actions with a sense of duty to help all oppressed people in America, as seen through her decision to have a baby to carry on her fight for freedom. It is through analyzing her demystification and self-education that readers can truly appreciate Assata’s transformation to empower herself and others. <br/><br/>
  By narrating her childhood development from her adult perspective, Assata is able to inject retrospective insights into her anecdotes, demonstrating how demystification has clarified her personal sense of beauty and identity. Assata “remember[s] teasing [her sister] about her lips” as a child, once telling her that “‘with those big lips, the only thing you’ve got going for you is your long hair; you better never cut it off’” (31). She follows the memory with a reflective comment, “I will never know how much damage all my ‘teasing’ did to my sister” (31). The story itself shows how Assata used to blindly confine her definition of beauty to white standards, while her retrospective comment reflects on the detrimental implication of that view. Assata continues a pattern of story-telling followed by her adult insights, recalling “[going] to the beauty parlor and [getting her] hair straightened” despite “the smell of fried hair and having [her] ears burned” (31). Retrospectively, Assata comments that at the time, “everybody knew you had to be crazy to walk the streets with nappy hair sticking out…We all knew that” (31). Among stories of her younger self wholeheartedly conforming, Assata acknowledges that “[everybody] had been completely brainwashed and [they] didn’t even know it. [They] accepted white value systems and white standards of beauty” (31). By following each anecdote with her present-day opinions, Assata draws contrasts between herself as a child and as an educated adult. And it is through the process of such demystification, rather than school education, that Assata becomes enlightened about her place in America as a Black woman. While in school she learned to idolize George Washington, she later discovered that “he had once sold a slave for a keg of rum” and “didn’t give a damn about Black people” (33). And while “[she] was crazy about Lincoln” in fourth grade, she later learned that “Lincoln was an archracist who had openly expressed his disdain for Black people” (33). These experiences teach her that white culture is not made for Black people. In fact, despite her efforts to embrace white culture—such as purchasing an Elvis Presley photo—she is repeatedly excluded, as “Elvis had said the only thing a Black person could do for him was to buy his records and shine his shoes” (39). Moreover, as she continually pursues the process of demystification, Assata questions the information that she is fed by those in power and realizes that her old beliefs—such as “that integration was really the solution to [Black people’s] problems”—were just “a bad joke” (139). Consequently, Assata begins to question the notion of white beauty and discovers the beauty existing within her own race:<br/>

Adult Assata’s disgust at how her people are oppressed through white standards of beauty demonstrates how she has grown since she was young, when she used to accept the oppression by straightening her hair. As Assata experiences life in ways that contradict how it is traditionally portrayed, she matures. She learns to embrace her beauty, which shapes her self-identity around herself rather than white influence: “In a country that is trying to completely negate the image of Black people, that constantly tells us we are nothing, our culture is nothing, I felt and still feel that we have got to constantly make positive statements about ourselves” (174-175). In this sense, her personal decision to love her hair is a political move against white cultural hegemony. By embracing herself, she is embracing her movement, which sets the scene for the rest of her actions in her life.<br/><br/>
By seeking more knowledge, Assata not only learns to embrace her black beauty and identity as a woman but also develops a sense of duty to help all of Black people in America, further shaping her as a revolutionary. As a young adult, Assata “enter[s] Manhattan Community College” and studies subjects such as “history, psychology, and sociology” at a time “when Black consciousness and nationalism [are] on the upswing” (173). As she gains knowledge, she begins to find her larger calling from Black history. In her poem “The Tradition,” Assata references the fights Black people have put up against white oppression, starting from the beginning “in Ghana and Mali and Timbuktu” and continuing on to revolts “on slave ships” and the creation of the Underground Railroad (263). She proudly references the creation of Black culture in America through “chants, cantatas, poems, blues,” and how Black People have persevered against “water hoses and bulldogs,” “nightsticks and bullets,” and “tanks and tear gases” (264). Her poem holistically encompasses the chronicle of the Black fight for freedom. Assata’s attention to this big picture indicates that her paradigm has expanded to emphasize a greater movement: to carry on the tradition of agitating against the majority for rights. Thus, all of her subsequent actions can be contextualized within this greater purpose. For example, her decision to have a baby while in prison is a deliberate means to propel her movement for civil rights forward. She recognizes that during slavery, Black women were forced to birth children “for the purpose of increasing [the slavemaster’s] stock” (116). The meaning of sex and childbirth was inextricably tied to the dehumanization of Black women. However, by making the choice to have a baby by her own will, Assata turns childbirth into a symbol of agency over her own body and life: “‘I’m not letting these parasites, these oppressors…make me kill my children in my mind, before they are even born’” (93). Moreover, she extends the meaning of her baby to the movement as a whole: “‘Our children are our futures and I believe in the future and in the strength and rightness of our struggle’” (93). Her attitude on childbirth echoes the spirit of her poem “The Tradition.” She upends the old use of childbirth determined by slaveholders and white oppressors, and changes it into a way to carry on the Black tradition, even going as far as equating her baby to “the new Black messiah” (123). Consequently, her baby becomes a form of resistance to white oppression. While as a child she primarily focused on her own concerns, adult Assata demonstrates that she is now thinking of the entire people. She believes that “any community seriously concerned with its own freedom has to be concerned about other people’s freedom as well,” and that “each time one of imperialism’s tentacles is cut off we are closer to liberation” (267). Assata’s education cultivates within her a broad commitment to social justice. To generate fuel for her movement for social justice, she redefines oppressive standards to empower minorities, whether through changing the meaning of beauty or of childbirth.<br/><br/>
In becoming a revolutionary, Assata has been shaped by influences from white oppression, higher education, and crude life experiences, all of which have led to her demystification. When narrating her childhood from a retrospective perspective, Assata disapprovingly comments on her old conception of beauty to show how she has grown politically and personally. Her higher education has also made her aware of the tradition of her people’s fight against oppression, and gives her purpose to carry it on. To deliberately oppose white cultural hegemony, she embraces her natural beauty even though it is not socially accepted and, on her own terms, decides to have a baby to carry her movement into the next generation. By learning about all the ways in which her people have nobly fought for social justice, Assata’s internal motivation gets stronger and becomes an example to others. She learns that she cannot liberate only herself; she has to liberate her community, and communities beyond her own. Critically, this new purpose is a quality that makes Assata a unique revolutionary that readers can learn from. Especially now, it is imperative to keep eyes fixed on the greater purpose behind this movement. If forgotten, half of a society might never come out from under their wigs. </p>


  <h4 id="assatah4">
  The more I thought about [wearing my hair in an Afro, natural], the better it sounded. I had always hated frying my hair—burnt ears, a smokey straightening, and the stink of your own hair burning…[I was] afraid my hair would “go back.” Back to where? Back to the devil or Africa… And then I became aware of a whole new generation of Black women hiding under wigs. Ashamed of their hair—if they had any left. It was sad and disgusting. (174)
