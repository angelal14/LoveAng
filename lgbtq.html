  <h1>Coming out</h1>

	<p>I'm bisexual! Surprise. Some thoughts on coming out... <br/><br/><br/><br/>

  - Straight shouldn't be the default sexual orientation. The default should be "I don't know until I ask them." There. Then if you're straight, bisexual, gay, lesbian, asexual, or WHATEVER, you all share the experience of "coming out." Beautiful. <br/><br/>
  - If you don't know how to react when someone comes out to you, just say, "Thank you for telling me." You don't have to feign that 'it doesn't matter to you' or whatever...just...say thank you. :) <br/><br/><br/><br/>

  That's all, thank you.
